Blinkit Data Analyst Project 📊

Welcome to my Blinkit Data Analyst Project, where I explored real-world data to draw actionable insights that could help optimize operations and improve customer satisfaction for a fast-paced delivery business like Blinkit.

📌 Project Overview
This project simulates how a data analyst would handle Blinkit’s operational and sales data — right from importing raw datasets to generating meaningful reports and dashboards.

Key tasks include:

- Cleaning and preparing data for analysis
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Generating KPIs and insights
- Visualizing trends and patterns
- Suggesting data-driven recommendations
